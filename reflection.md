# Hello World

1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

Source control is important because it helps to ensure that changes made to the code by multiple users does not clash and cause errors, and it also helps to ensure that no malicious code has been written into the app because anyone can view and review the code as it is updated and changed.

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

A local repository is a repository that is located on the machine of the person working on it, whereas a remote repository is located on a server that can be accessed by multiple users. Synchronization is essential because it allows developers to work simultaneously on the same repository and changes can be synched to the main branch so that the project is updated as they go, without having to worry about errors caused by mismatching versions of the project.
